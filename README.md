# windowssetup

A PowerShell script to setup my Windows desktop.

I mostly use it for gaming, but also some testing purposes, hence why it's quite games-centric, and also quite barebone.

## Getting started

```shell
git clone git@github.com:fharper/windowssetup.git
cd windowssetup
./windowssetup.ps1
```

Have fun!
